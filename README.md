## hello! thanks for coming to take a look at my work!

at present, my time is dominated by my studies at university.
  if my contributions look a little sparse, it's mostly because my uni repos are private (no cheating!)

my favorite projects lately have been using #Kotlin# in android studio, as it's my first foray into mobile development.
  i've also been learning a lot about the #UE5 game engine#, and am expanding into learning #Godot# as well!

if you'd like to hear a little more about what i've been doing in my day-to-day, feel free to reach out on linkedin/through email.
  email being --->    evaskaufman@gmail.com
âœ¨thank you for reading and have a lovely day!âœ¨
